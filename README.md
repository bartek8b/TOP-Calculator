# odin-calculator
I purposely put limitations on myself while working on this project so that I could feel that there were hardware limitations. I wanted my calculator to behave like a real old digital calculator with a 10-digit display. I tried different sequences of operations on a physical calculator and then tried to implement its behavior in my program.

Try to make operation and use equals several times etc.
